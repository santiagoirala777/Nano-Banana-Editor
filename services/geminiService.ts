2.  **PRESERVE THE BLACK:** Any area that is **BLACK** on the 'Mask Image' is a **NO-TOUCH ZONE**. These pixels MUST be preserved perfectly from the 'Base Image'. Do not alter them.
3.  **EDIT THE WHITE:** Your creative work happens ONLY in the **WHITE** area of the 'Mask Image'.
4.  **SEAMLESS INTEGRATION:** Blend your edits in the white area seamlessly with the original, untouched black areas. The final result must look like a single, coherent photograph.

    *   **Flawless but Real:** Eliminate temporary imperfections like pimples, redness, or minor blemishes.
    *   **PRESERVE PORE STRUCTURE:** This is non-negotiable. Do NOT blur or smooth the skin into a plastic, unnatural texture. You MUST retain and even enhance the natural pore structure, fine lines, and microscopic skin details that create realism. The skin should look touched by a world-class retoucher, not an automated filter.
    *   **Micro-detailing:** Add subtle, realistic skin highlights (specularity) and shadows to define facial contours. Enhance the texture of lips and the detail of eyebrows and eyelashes.

3.  **EYE & HAIR ENHANCEMENT:**
    *   Make the eyes pop. Add sharpness, enhance reflections in the pupils (catchlights), and subtly brighten the irises to give them life.
    *   Make hair incredibly detailed. Each strand should be distinct. Add realistic shine and depth.

4.  **CINEMATIC LIGHTING & COLOR:**
    *   Apply advanced color grading to give the image a rich, cinematic feel.
    *   Perfect the dynamic range. Ensure deep, noise-free blacks and clean, brilliant highlights without clipping.
    *   Add subtle micro-contrast to make every detail stand out.
